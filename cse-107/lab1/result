Does the probability that Bob's tosses more heads than Alice's now seem to depend on ùëõ? 

It really does seem to depend on the value of n. 
The bigger n gets, the samller the relative frequency gets.
This is because the bigger n gets the smaller the affect of the one extra throw will be.
If we had a function like 2n or even n^2 for the throws that Bob gets,
than the probability of winning would be in favor of Bob.


Does that probability seem to approach a limiting value as ùëõ becomes large? 
Form a conjecture regarding this probability.

The probability does seem to approach a limitiing value of 0.5. This is due the fact that when n becomes larger. The one extra throw becomes insignificant compared to n other throws.
