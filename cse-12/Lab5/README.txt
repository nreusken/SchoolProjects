Lab 5: Functions and Graphics

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the functions can create solid and normal circles, and clear the bitmap screan. The code can also find the color of a pixel wiht the appropriate coordinates.
Using the test asm file in the same directory, you can test that Lab5 file and see if it works and should create a shape on the 128 x 128 Bitmap display wiht the base address at 0xFFFF0000(memory map)

-----------
FILES

-
Lab5.asm

This file includes the assembly code of the lab.

-
lab5_s20_test.asm

This file includes the assembly code to create the picture used to check if code is working right.

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS). Use the test file in the same directory as the lab file and run the test file using MARS with Bitmap display connected.
