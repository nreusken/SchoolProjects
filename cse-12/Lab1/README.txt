Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab. the user can flip the switches on or off. 
For part A, the 7 segment display will show the 4-bit binary number assigned to that switch. 
	To see circtuits go to page 4.
For part B, the three LED's are the outputs of the circuits, on representing 1, off represeting 0. 
	To see circtuits go to page 5.
For part A, the three LED's are the outputs of the same truth table but the circuits made with different gates.
	To see circtuits go to page 6.

This file inludes the circuits and the switches.
The applitaciton MultiMedia Logic was used to create the circuits with switches.

INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be run on MultiMedia Logic. Flip the switches to get the desired input.
When the switch is on, input values equals 1, if the switch switch is off, input equals 0.
