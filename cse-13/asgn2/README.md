This program compare the built in cos, sin, tan and exp functions 
to the functions written in the program; 
	using the Pad√© approcimant for sin, cos, and tan.
	and using taylor series for exp.

To compile the program use the command: make.
	This will compile the program using the Makefile.

When compiled the file math will be created and the program is ready to run.

The program can run the comparisons for just one of the functions
	or all by specifying the option after ./math.
	
	1.-s: runs sin tests
	2.-c: runs cos tests
	3.-t: runs tan tests	
	4.-e: runs exp tests
	5.-a: runs all tests
